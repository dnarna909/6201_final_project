Hi All,

We will continue an (abbreviated) COVID analysis from the Team programming assignment with same teams. Working in a team, please complete the following assignment and prepare a 15 minute presentation for last class day in which each Team member presents at least one slide. There is only one assignment per team. Grading will be based on Teamwork evaluation and presentation quality.

1. Make a heatmap of omicron Peak per capita deaths for 500 most populous counties. Need to get county population information.

You can download county data from here:

https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/research/evaluation-estimates/2020-evaluation-estimates/2010s-counties-total.html (Links to an external site.)

2. Plot total Omicron deaths per capita vs the current county vaccination rate.

 Center for Disease Control (CDC) for COVID 19 vaccinations for each county within each states of the United States from the website:
